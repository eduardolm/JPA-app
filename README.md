# JPA-App
Sample app created with JPA to practice JPSQL, JPA Criteria API and plain SQL queries in Java.

## Goals

Main goals were to practice using plain SQL, JPQL and JPA Criteria API to write queries in Java.
JPA was also used to persist data to MySQL DB.

## How to use

In order to use this app, one must have access to a running MySQL instance.

Clone this repository, go to resources -> META_INF -> persistence-dev.xml

and change the variables according to your DB connection. Rename the file to persisntence.xml.

Just run the app. It works as a console app, and the commands are all written inside the main class.

*This is just a practice app and should not be considered as a fully working production-level app.
It was really created in order to practice and as a simple reference.
